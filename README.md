# WomenInTech: 

## Overview of the Problem

**Target Population of Interest:** Women in Machine Learning and Data Science  Technology roles in the United States who responded to annual Surveys of various sources.

According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, "Employment in computer and information technology occupations is projected to grow faster than the average for all occupations."

**Problem Statement:** Despite the growth in Technology jobs the number of Women in the United States that are occupying roles in Technology is significantly less than their male counterparts. When we look at the women's representation in the Data Science field the gender imbalance still remains to be true. 

**Question:**  What is the difference between the percentage of the women population (Kaggle Survey respondent) and men population (Kaggle Survey respondents) who occupied Technology roles in Machine Learning and Data Science in the United States? 


Null Hypothesis: | Alternative Hypothesis:
------------ | -------------
There is NO difference between the percentage of the women population  and the men population who occupied Technology roles in Machine Learning and Data Science in the United States| There IS a difference between the percentage of the women population  and the men population who occupied Technology roles in Machine Learning and Data Science in the United States


## Objectives
In Our analysis, we will compare the 2020 survey results against the previous two years surveys to determine the key differences between men & women within the Kaggle Survey dataset in order to reject the null hypythosis and conclude that gender imbalance exists.  Furthermore, we will seek to understand the state of Women in ML and DS Technology roles. We will utilize a Supervised Machine learning algorithm to predict salary of women in ML & DA role based on years of experience.

**Measure of Success** : The success of the project is dependent on the group ability to analyze the data and provide the necessary insight that speaks to the gender imbalance that exist in  in Machine Learning and Data Science  Technology roles while also predicting the role role a women will occupy within ML & DS based on a variety of factors.

**Data Source Details:**

**1. What is the highest level of formal education that you have attained or plan to attain within the next 2 years(Q4)?** 
a) No formal education past high school b) Some college/university study without earning a bachelor’s degree c) Bachelor’s degree d) Master’s degree e) Doctoral degree f) Professional degree g) I prefer not to answer

**2. Select the title most similar to your current role or most recent title if retired(Q5):**  
a) Business Analyst b) Data Analyst c) Data Engineer d) Data Scientiste) DBA/Database Engineer f) Machine Learning Engineerg) Product/Project Managerh) Research Scientist i) Software Engineerj) Statistician k) Student l) Currently not employed m) Other

**3. For how many years have you been writing code and/or programming(Q6)?** 
a) I have never written code b) < 1 years c) 1-2 years d) 3-5 years e) 5-10 years f) 10-20 years g) 20+ years
 
**5. What is the size of the company where you are employed(Q20)?** 
a) 0-49 employees b) 50-249 employees c) 250-999 employees d) 1000-9,999 employees e) 10,000 or more employees

**6. What is your current yearly compensation(Q24)?**  



## GitHub Repository Details
The Women in Tech Github Repo has a main branch and 5 branches that are specific to the feature component of the project. The name of the branches are follows:
1. ETL-Extract_Transform_Load
2. Database
3. Machine_Learning
4. Visualization
5. Presentation

## Machine Learning Model
### Quantitative data analysis methods
The Linear Regression model machine learning model is the provisional machine learning model that stands in for the final machine learning model.
The model would measure the degree of difference years of experience and its impact on the salary of women developers. In other see if there’s any kind of correlation between how a women salary be based on their years of experience. Additional variable (may/will) be analyzed to deter if any correlation exist. 


**Target Variable: Salary**

Input Variable | Output Variable
------------ | -------------
X |y
Years of Experience | Salary
 

##  Database Integration

**DataFrame**
The provisional that will mimics the expected final database structure or schema will encapass the following columns/features from the dataframe the group created utlizing kaggle survey data from a csv file.
